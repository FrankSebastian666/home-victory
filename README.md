This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for a class at Hochschule Merseburg.

## Getting Started

-   First, clone into the Github repository.
-   Open the project with a IDE, e.g. VS Code.
-   Run the following command in your Terminal to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Accessing the live Website on localhost

To see the live Website in Development Mode on localhost:3000, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If you want to edit something, just edit one of the `**/**.tsx`-files. The page on localhost auto-updates as you edit the file.
